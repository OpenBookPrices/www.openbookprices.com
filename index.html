<h1>Book Price API</h1>

<p>
  OpenBookPrices is an API that lets you find the current prices for books at
  different vendors, including shipping to different countries. It will also
  convert the prices into the currency you request.
</p>

<p>
  It is free to use and requires no authentication or sign up.
</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>
  This is an example <a href="http://api.openbookprices.com/prices/9780340831496/US/USD">request</a>
  for prices of the excellent "McGee on Food and Cooking". The response is JSON
  so it would not have the inline comments shown below:
