<h1>Getting book details</h1>

<p>The API can tell you basic details about a book, such as author and price.
To get these you need to know the ISBN of the book.</p>

<h2>A note on ISBNs</h2>

<p>An ISBN is the "International Standard Book Number" and is unique for each
book. It is usually printed at the back of the book near the barcode (see <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number">Wikipedia
 ISBN entry</a> for an example).</p>

<p>ISBN numbers look like <tt>1619493918</tt> or
<tt>978-1619493919</tt>. Both of these refer to the same book, the first is
an ISBN-10 and the second an ISBN-13 (which were introduced when they started
running out of of 10 char ones).</p>


<h2>Getting book details</h2>

<p>The API returns book details using urls of the form:</p>

{% highlight html %}
http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/<isbn>/details
{% endhighlight %}

<p>So for example for an isbn of <tt>9781619493919</tt> the url and response would be:</p>

<p><a href="http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9781619493919/details">http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9781619493919/details</a></p>

{% highlight json %}
{
  "authors": [
    "Henry David Thoreau"
  ],
  "title": "Walden",
  "isbn": "9781619493919"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you use the ISBN-10 in the URL the API will redirect you to the ISBN-13. The
API tries to correct all such errors by redirects rather that 404s or 400s.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl -i http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/1619493918/details
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

Moved Permanently. Redirecting to http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9781619493919/details
{% endhighlight %}
