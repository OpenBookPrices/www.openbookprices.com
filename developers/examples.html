<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>These are simple examples that you should be able to try in your browser.
The API returns JSON which your browser will display more nicely with a plugin
like <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=jsonview">JSONView</a> or a
tool like <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> (for Chrome).</p>

<p>For more see the <a href="http://docs.openbookprices.apiary.io/">full API docs</a>.</p>

<h2>Basic book details</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/details">http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/details</a>
</p>

<p>Get some very basic details about the book (eg title, authors).</p>

<h2>Prices</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/prices">http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/prices</a>
</p>

<p>No country or currency specified so will geolocate using your IP address and
redirect. Then displays all vendors that ship to where you are and the details
that we currently hove cached. Does not block on scraping prices so returns
very fast.</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/prices/FR/EUR">http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/prices/FR/EUR</a>
</p>

<p>As above but with the country and currency specified (<tt>FR</tt> for France
and <tt>EUR</tt> for Euro). If you leave out the currency then the primary
currency for the country will be looked up and redirected to.</p>

<p>The returned JSON contains the country and currency so you don't need to
detect the redirect and parse the final url.</p>

<hr>

<p>
  <a href="http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/prices/FR/EUR/amazon_us">http://api.openbookprices.com/v1/books/9780131103627/prices/FR/EUR/amazon_us</a>
</p>

<p>Get the pricing for an individual vendor, in this case <tt>amazon_us</tt>
with shipping to Fronce and the amounts converted into Euros. If we don't have
fresh data then we'll fetch it from the vendor using their API or scraping them
so this might take longer to return, but once it does it is cached on the CDN
so it'll be faster next time.</p>

<p>Note that the response is identical to the entries in the <tt>results</tt>
array for the non-vendor request, so you can use the same piece of code to
process them both.</p>
