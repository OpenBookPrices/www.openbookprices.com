<h1>We â™¡ developers!</h1>

<p>We <strong>are</strong> developers and we've suffered plenty of terrible
APIs. Weird naming, crazy auth, lousy documentation, overly complicated,
expensive. Blech!</p>

<p>Our API is none of these because we've built it all with a view to being
developer friendly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no auth, or signup, or tokens.</li>
  <li>It's free (both speech and beer).</li>
  <li>It only returns JSON.</li>
  <li>The URL is the request (no headers, no sessions).</li>
  <li>Auto-corrects arguments using redirects when possible.</li>
  <li>Response is easy to work with.</li>
  <li>Built in geolocation based on requestor's IP address.</li>
  <li>Heavily cached using global CDN.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Quick start</h2>

<p>The API should be fairly self explanatory. Most endpoints have links to
related ones and the urls are hackable. Try it by going to <a
href="http://api.openbookprices.com/">http://api.openbookprices.com/</a> (you
might need to install a <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=browser+JSON+viewer+extension">JSON
viewer</a>).</p>

<p>There are also <a href="/developers/examples.html">lots of examples with
notes</a> which give a pretty good overview of the whole API.</p>
