<h1>What's Missing?</h1>

<p>The API is still in active development! There are several things that are
obviously missing. Please see the <a href="/roadmap">roadmap</a> to see what's
coming, and feel free to look at <a href="/contribute">contributing</a> if
you'd like to help.</p>

<p>If what you want is not on the roadmap, please <a
href="https://github.com/OpenBookPrices/openbookprices-api/issues">create a
ticket</a> requesting it!</p>

<p>Also if any of this tutorial was unclear please let me know. Email to <a
href="mailto:hello@openbookprices.com">hello@openbookprices.com</a> or tweet me
at <a href="https://twitter.com/evdb">@evdb</a>. Or, for super karma, fix it in
a pull request on this website's <a
href="https://github.com/OpenBookPrices/www.openbookprices.com">GitHub
repo</a>!</p>
