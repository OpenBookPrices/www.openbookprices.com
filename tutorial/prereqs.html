<h1>Prerequisites</h1>


<h2>An internet connection</h2>

<p>At times you'll want to run some queries against the live API to see how it
responds.</p>


<h2>A JSON viewer plugin in your browser</h2>

<p>The API returns all its data as <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>, which is a simple data format that
looks like this:</p>

{% highlight json %}
{% include json-sample.json %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The above is syntaxed highlighted to make it easier to read and this is how
samples will appear in this tutorial. However when you request the JSON from
the API your browser will either display it as text or try to save it as a
file. By using a JSON viewing plugin or extension you'll see the results in the
browser and will be easily able to follow links embedded.</p>

<p>I recommend using
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en">JSONView for Chrome</a>
or
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview/">JSONView for Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't use either Chrome or Firefox as your browser then try searching
for "JSON viewer [your browser]". Or install
<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>
or
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/â€Ž">Firefox</a> (their debug tools come in handy too).</p>

<p>Try loading the above <a href="/tutorial/json-sample.json">JSON in
your browser</a> to check it is all working.</p>
